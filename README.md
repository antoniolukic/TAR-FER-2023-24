The internet is a widespread platform where anyone can share their thoughts and opinions, often leading to the spread of unverified information and false rumours. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon, where users
frequently post and react to content without verifying its accuracy. This proliferation of misinformation presents significant challenges
in detecting and managing false rumours. In this paper, we investigate the impact of learning with heterogeneous datasets on final scores
in rumour detection tasks. Additionally, we examine how the utilization of only replies versus incorporating both source texts and replies
affects the categorization of replies in social media rumour analysis.
