the human brain is made of omega3 fatty acids. There are 3 types of omega3: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The brain is made from DHA. There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds,  etc are NOT DHA.

Many people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently. In these cases the body will incorporate nonDHA fatty acids into the membrane of the brain. However there is at least some evidence that this leads to suboptimal results like emotional or mood issues, attention issues, or anger issues. However the specifics are widely debated

But again, that makes sense. People who buy their fancy Himalayan pink salt don't want added iodine because they want the pure ""natural"" chemicals or whatever. People who bake with salt don't general want added iodine because it can impart an off flavor when baked. Same for people who want to do brines. And so on. 

 Never the less, 90% of the salt sold is the cheap table salt variety which does contain iodine. The number of products does not tell you what people buy. There is only one cheapest brand of anything, and yet most people will buy that. We have options to buy both easily because there are good reasons to buy both. That is a good thing. 

In general, the more choices you have the better. If the government starts a smear campaign against iodized salt, sure.

Bias: Extreme Right, Hate Group

Notes: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a non-profit research organization “that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views.” It was started as a spin-off from John Tanton’s Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in 1985. Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC). Bottom line, this is a hate group. (2/8/2017)

http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/mar/22/center-immigration-studies-hate-group-southern-pov/

Speaking from an outside perspective (UK)The SPLC has done it's due dilligence in this matter, from the politifact link alone I would agree with their sentiment.

Your problem is that you are ignoring the fact that conservwtive views
Are being espoused by the alt-right and neo-nazi/KKK crowd, after all david duke endorsed trump, the alt-right and tge neo-nazis and the KKK follow a conservative ideology and believe that conservative policy will bring about their version of the U.S (the 1850's social mess, pre suffrage or civil rights movement or a white ethnostate, with P.O.C and minorites expelled or enslaved).

If you don't want them coopting your platform, chsnge your platform how hard is it to not want to treat women, P.O.C and minorities like shit? You have neo-nazis running for office in the conservative party (GOP, illinois, california, minnesota/michigan). The current GOP platform gives a voice to these types of hate and extreme views, call your rep, ask to denounce them at least, put some fucking effort in.

8j9s33,dyyt4za,"...

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. 

Some men.

A minority of men.

A sub-population of men.

Certain kinds of men.

Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.

But not all men. 

You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. 

And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done.

8j9s33,dyya382,"&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.

First, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary ""benefit"" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as ""tougher"" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone.

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] ",3

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of 
Undocumented Immigrants"" Not immigrants..

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

&gt; Nonetheless, results show that undocumented immigrants 
generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice 
system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of 
criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused 
consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime 
reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented 
immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., 
intensified policing), or a combination of factors.

Because the current administration is making legal immigration more difficult. The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.

Look, I get the whole ""you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop.""

No one has to read shampoo instructions by the way, they're only there cause its legally required in some places.

It is still extremely stupid though, as your choosing a poorly worded, irrelevant, and blatantly nonsensical attempt at an insult over an actual argument for the point you were trying to make.

Altogether, your response has zero relevance with the post or my initial comment so now you just look even more retarded than you did for trying to argue that the picture and the title are not of relation to each other. Let me explain something to you that you seem to not understand. 
The reason O.P. Is asking the question is because they saw the photo and the numbers sound iffy. It makes no sense that they would have had the question and then found a corresponding photo. The question O.P. asks in the title is meant to be based on what is in the picture; their questions wording doesn't specify that they mean this specific incident but if any sort of common sense is used you can see that they're asking based on a specific incident because thats what is discussed in the photo that leads to the question. I think your confusion is based largely on the last words of the sentence ""in its entire existence"" if you use the photo for context, as that is where the question stems from, its clear that the ""it"" in that sentence is humanity and not the mountain.

In the UK (where I live), there are high-flouride areas in the North (where I happened to grow up), and low-flouride areas in the South.

Dentists recognised long ago that there was a regional difference in oral health that exactly matched the natural differences in flouride levels in the local water supplies.

Are we supposed to believe that nobody, at the same time, noticed a corresponding adverse effect?  There would be distinct correlation between having good teeth and dyslexia/adhd.  I find it hard to believe that no one noticed that in the last 40 years.",3
4dfdvo,d1r5goy,"By no means an I an expert on this, so please take this reply with a grain of salt.

The lead in municipal water supplies is not added, it comes from the water pipes themselves.  Most cities main water pipes were constructed 50 - 100+ years ago and contain a large amount of lead.. even homes built before 1986 may contain lead pipes and lead solder.  As the pipes corrode lead enters the water supply.

The biggest difference between ingesting lead and fluoride is fluoride is water soluble lead is not.  So your body will get rid of fluoride (like it does with most things you ingest), lead on the other hand is a heavy metal and your body has no way of dealing with it.  Over time, the lead builds up in our system causing toxicity  This is known as bioaccumulation.

4dfdvo,d1qj24g,"The title ""Fluoride Officially Classified as a Neurotoxin in World’s Most Prestigious Medical Journal"" is exceptionally silly. Just being published in the lancet doesn't confer any official status on anything; the same journal later published [criticism](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2814%2970119-X/fulltext?hc_location=ufi) of that same paper.",3
4dfdvo,d1rli1y,Best response. As someone with ADHD I was pretty interested in this one. Thanks!!,3
4dfdvo,d1rfaf8,"Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.

The website refers to this study: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable."" 

If you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621182/):""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.""

So the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.

TL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect.  Debunked.",3

4dfdvo,d23k9ry,"One thing ""scare articles"" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. 

The whole thing came about as a result of a condition called ""texas teeth"".  Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay.  The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water.  Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked.  So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it.  Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.

I'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride.  At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water.  However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.

My mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available.  My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager.  My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it.  Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios.  My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school ""treatment"" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes.

But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:

1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.

2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.

3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.

4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.

So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...

a) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.

b) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.

c) The bible literalists are wrong.

31xv6u,cq6do3d,"&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be “in between,” as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these “transitional forms,” as they are called, should be abundant. 

Firstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be ""abundant."" [Fossilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Fossilization_processes) is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. 

Secondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a ""transitional form"" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask ""Where's the transitional form between A and B?""

31xv6u,cq6dipq,"&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists’ story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old

This is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.

You can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.
