Phone metadata: This includes the “call pairs” — the two phone numbers on a call, plus the date, time and duration of the call.

Email metadata: The “to” and “from” email addresses, along with the IP addresses and subject lines. Basically it’s the same information you’d see on the envelope of a postal letter.

Similar metadata *WAS* collected for text messages, Facebook DMs and the like. The purpose of metadata is to weed out your cat meme emails, which NSA doesn’t care about nor does it read or retain, and to zero in on real suspects for targeted surveillance (which, as you’ll read below, requires an individual warrant for U.S. persons).

What is “minimization?” This is the procedure NSA uses to safeguard the privacy of American citizens. Part of this process includes the anonymization/encryption of personal information, transforming proper names, for example, into random strings of characters called “designators.”

The Washington Post has revised its article. Just one day later, with no acknowledgment except for a 
change in the timestamp, the Post revised the story, 
backing down from sensational claims it made originally. But the damage was already done. 
The article no longer reports that the tech companies gave 
the NSA ""Unrestricted direct access to servers"". 
But, more importantly, the phrase “track a person’s movements and contacts over time” was revised to 
“track foreign targets.” There’s a huge difference between the two phrases. 
Public outrage was almost entirely based on the idea that the NSA was spying on everyone who uses those services, 
broad, unrestricted access to private information. 
But the revision limits the scope of the operation to *international communications*.

http://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-updates-spying-story-2013-6 

According to The Washington Post. ""PRISM gives the U.S. government access to email, documents, audio, video, 
photographs and other data belonging to foreigners on foreign soil who are under investigation.""

I suppose the various flavorings added could theoretically cause issues, it's hard to say exactly what they're made of.

25bvmb,chfogbk,"Actually, he is right, kind of.  Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively.  Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use.  It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes.  

Is nicotine good for you?  No, its not.  It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems.  However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects.  It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig.

&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK — Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.

Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction


Also, wikipedia has alot of this information.

Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe.  This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent.  This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe.  They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient.  My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.",0

22o24j,cgoq9oi,"This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the 15%-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.

For one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only 15-20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).

While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?

[This](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a 50% fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.

Simply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the 15-20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.",3

There's also the fundamental role that it plays in ""fire and maneuver"" tactics.  One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere.

22o24j,cgoq924,"Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:

&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average 100 men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only 15 men on average would take any part with the weapons.  This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25% of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.

And

&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...

Marshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today.  [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy.  (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill.  These weren't firing lines 100 yards apart.  Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)

Still, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.",3
22o24j,cgosp65,"This is a great answer. I have read all 3 books you mention, discussed it with professors and veterans. Many people agree that his number is either fabricated or based off a ""gut feeling."" 

What is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. 

For Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things. Like /u/kombatminipig said, he is very selective in his evidence.

Finally Engen. All I can say is that he is a top notch academic, and *Canadians Against Fire* is a solid piece of work. 

",1
22o24j,cgoqevd,"That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.

I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.

Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that 75% of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.

In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.

There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.

So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.

If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.

Engen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.

Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!

So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.

If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are:

http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1081/1/Engen_Robert_C_200803_MA.pdf

In the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:

http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo9/18-grossman-eng.asp",1
22o24j,cgoq6kj,"Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind 20% of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ 0 (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like ""Brennan’s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall’s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army
captain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not
recall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the
journalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea."" ^1

I would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between 25,000 to 100,000 rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).

I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.


I apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ .


On a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire.

22o24j,cgovmm6,"Sleeping bags are comforting, and a bombardment can be *really* scary.  Also, there were accusations of incredible negligent and shoddy leadership on the Argentinian side (there were trials regarding to extremely poor treatment of the conscripts fairly recently), which would explain very poor reactions to incoming fire.

In general, people do not act rationally when put under sudden and extreme stress, especially if there isn't any stable presence to guide their reactions.  If your commander is telling you to get to bunkers, directing you to positions, and acting like he's still in control of the situation, you're going to have a much better chance of reacting well.

He commonly claims that artillery and other crew served weapons do the majority of killing even in a direct action, yet one can with very little trouble find several battles where one or both sides had little trouble inflicting terrific casualties on the other using accurate and deliberate fire, without artillery being involved. The Battle of Inkerman would be my favourite example. ",3
22o24j,cgot99h,"*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.  I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them.  It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true.  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?

The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:

&gt; ""Everyone stop!  OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him.""

Almost everything in this area is laced with bias.  Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology.  *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.

Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research.  What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.",3

Still - here we are.

First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists, the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others.

No because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.

Since the stuff we're concerned about is ""fossil fuel"", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.",3
5mkmg1,dc49ttw,"Lol natural news.

On a serious note, even if the 97% consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.

Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:

Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.

The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.

Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.

I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.

President Trump [left for the UK on Friday 24th June](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday 24th June](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746272130992644096) - around 10am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746273889160957952) around 10.30am.

No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.

The guy couldn't remember basic facts.

-------

Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there.

On meeting with President Putin:

&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it’s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I’ll be talking about nuclear proliferation.

On Nato spending:

&gt; I say we pay 90 percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.

He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/) of [sources](https://www.nato.int/cps/ie/natohq/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.

On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:

&gt;  It’s not good for Europe and it’s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We’re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don’t have immigration laws — I don’t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you’re tied in a lawsuit for five years.

On the UK-US special relationship:

&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it’s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough — if they don’t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It’s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.

On Russia invading Ukraine:

&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea — I wouldn’t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We’ll have to see what happens ... I’m not bad at doing things. Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.

On Theresa May:

&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.

On the Russia meeting:

&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it’s a dream, but it’s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I’m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia.

The BBC and ITV called the election at roughly 4.40am. All of which would have been while President Trump was on the plane.

Secondly, let's look at what he actually said, based on [this transcript](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):

&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.

So it doesn't matter if he flew into the UK on 23rd (he didn't), or if technically the result hadn't been called when he arrived (it had been), because his claim was about opening the course the day before.

So even if we take ""Brexit"" to be on 24th June (rather than the day of the vote) he was still wrong. He got his events in the wrong order.",3

6o9ozz,dkforfa,"You are on the right track. A few additional points : 

* The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. 
* * See the fuel paradox section of this article https://medium.com/@landingattempts/why-do-rockets-use-so-much-fuel-118486244aba
* As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)
* *  Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.
* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.
* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)
* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to ""turn around"" at the time that the accident happened
* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian
* During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you 30 days, or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out.

6o9ozz,dkfsfyu,"Another short debunk from a nerd's perspective: play kerbal space program, and one of the first things you do is figure out how to land on and return from the moon (or Mun in this case).

S1 : ~500k Gallons
S2 : ~300k G
s3 : ~80k G
 
Probably unaccounted for here is the fuel to lift off from the moon, which was in separate tanks for the lunar module, and would not be that much due to the low gravity of the moon, and the much lower amount of mass being lifted. 

https://www.space.com/18422-apollo-saturn-v-moon-rocket-nasa-infographic.html",3
6o9ozz,dkh19wj,"Per my answer, thats actually not really true. The vast majority of the rocket was just to get us into Earth orbit. It only costs a fraction of additional fuel to get to the moon and back once you make it into space.

There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that.

Most likely somewhere in between. Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.

After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").

That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.

So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.

In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party.

Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury. And even if The Crown exercised real power now, Parliament would still be stronger. Hanoverian Kings exercised deal power daily but were weaker than Parliament.

Seems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:

&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. 

It all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its ""highly reliable source"". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.

&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.""

Seems entirely reasonable.

The Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should ""think very carefully"", that means that 

&gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. 

and that therefore

&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is?

- The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a “No” vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:
- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.
- All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.
- Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this (such as EEA membership or similar) would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer.
- While these timescales cannot be “known”, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. 
- Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.
- A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from 1989 to 1994
- 12.6% of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU, while only 3.1% of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK. Any proposition that that “they need us more than we need them” and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn’t hold up.
- The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails:
- Large membership fees
- Freedom of movement
- Following a vast majority of the laws
- All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.

http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6986518/Queen-hailed-as-a-backer-of-Brexit.html

&gt; THE Queen has been hailed as a backer of Brexit tonight after details emerged of an extraordinary alleged bust-up between her and Nick Clegg over Europe.

&gt; Her Majesty let rip at the then Deputy PM during a lunch at Windsor Castle, The Sun has been told.

&gt; The 89-year-old monarch firmly told passionate pro-EU Mr Clegg that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction.

49l01s,d0spd4e,"Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a ""capstone of a United States of Europe"". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme.  

Both here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics.

The British system entirely relies on convention which is what stops the queen from exercising her power to stop legislation passed in parliament and the Lords from blocking money bills. However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements.

In fairness I wish this was the way all corporate lobbying operated.

Petition your employees who then petition government and vote in their own interests (while taking on board the company's views).

Corporate political donations could work in a similar way.    

The amount of money a company was planning on donating gets divided up and each employee gets a 'campaign voucher' that they are free to give to any political party of their choosing. 

The company then petitions their employees on who they'd prefer the donations go to, why that party is better for the company and its employees, etc. And how the policies of that party will enable the company to grow, wages to rise, etc.
